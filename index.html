				<p>I am originally from Salina, KS. I have a bachelors degree in music from Fort Hays University where I
					studied
					percussion. After I graduated I got my first job as a drummer for Royal Caribbean Cruise line where
					I played the
					main
					stage headlined shows while cruising the beautiful Pacific Northwest and Hawaii!<br>
					After a short tour I moved to Kansas city where I have been for 11 years. I worked as a Musical
					theatre drummer at
					local theatres like the Rep, Amercian Heartland, New Theatre and Startlight theatre.<br>
					After my 5 yrs in musical theatre production I moved onto a job with a major cable company where I
					started out as
					an installer and worked my way up to now technical trainer. My hobby is 4-Wheelin' with Jeep
					Wranglers and belong
					to a Jeep club. I'm currently in coding bootcamp where I am very
					excited and egar to learn a new profession.</p>

				<p>After completing KU Fullstack Bootcamp, I have experience with Front End and Back End with a
					focus
					on MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node). </p>
