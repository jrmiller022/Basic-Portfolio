				<p>I am originally from Salina, KS. I have a bachelors degree in music from Fort Hays University where I studied percussion. After I graduated I got my first job as a drummer for Royal Caribbean cruise line where I played main stage headline shows while cruising the beautiful Pacific northwest and Hawaii!<br>
				After a short stent I moved to Kansas city where I have been for 10 yrs. I worked as a Musical theatre drummer at local theatres like the Rep, Amercian Heartland, New Theatre and Startlight theatre. <br> After my 5 yrs in musical theatre production I moved onto a job with a major cable company where I started out as an installer and worked my way up to now technical trainer. I'm currently in coding bootcamp where I am very excited and egar to learn a new profession.</p>
